# Code and Data to Replicate the Study "Supervised Reconstruction"

## Data

The data is originally coded in CLDF (Forkel et al. 2018) and then converted to TSV formats needed as input for the framework. The conversion is done automatically with the help of the [pyedictor](https://github.com/lingpy/pyedictor) tool. Two datasets are for now only offered in the form of a TSV file, since they were not published in this form before, but repositories in the form of CLDF are planned to be published later.
