# Source directory

This directory contains the "raw" source data from which the CLDF dataset in [cldf/](../cldf) was derived. The data is originally coded in CLDF (Forkel et al. 2018) and then converted to TSV formats needed as input for the framework. The conversion is done automatically with the help of the [`cldf/`](../cldf) is derived.

- `sed.tsv` is the file that pylexibank will use as input
- `sources.bib` contains the bibliographic references for the data
